## What The Tool Does

1. **Zero friction**: Single name input field
2. **3-second scan**: Concentric circles, terminal loading
3. **Deterministic score**: Same name = same score (critical for viral sharing)
4. **Brutal verdict**: One of 3 archetypes:
   - Apex Operator (7.5-10) - Green, "You're redlining"
   - High-Frequency Ghost (5.0-7.4) - Gold, "You're the reason Yale is at 40%"
   - Distracted Dilettante (1.0-4.9) - Red, "You need a cage"
5. **Radar chart**: 4 metrics (Magnitude, Gravitas, Lethality, Grit)
6. **Two CTAs**:
   - SHARE RESULTS → Twitter with pre-filled flex
   - ENHANCE MAGNITUDE → vectomind-engine.vercel.app?ref=aura_check

---

## Quick Response Templates

### When Someone Posts Low Score
```
brutal. but fixable if you're willing to enter the cage.

the tool that fixes the leak: vectomind-engine.vercel.app
```

### When Someone Posts High Score
```
apex operator detected.

but you're redlining without a safety protocol.

want the actual focus engine that prevents burnout?
```

### When Someone Says "This is Fake"
```
deterministic algorithm. same name = same score.

try it with your roommate's name, i'll wait.
```
